## Install

Available on the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pertl.johannes.jwst_status).

## How it works

The app scrapes data from the [official NASA website](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html) and
displays it in a mobile-friendly way.  
It also sends a push notification as soon as a new step has been reached.
